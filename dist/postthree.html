            <p>Working as a Doorman for the last 10 years you get to see a lot of crazy things. Recently I can recall I was speaking to this sweet young woman in the beginning of the night that told she was in town for the weekend and wanted to have a great time with her girls. As the night progressed I saw with a man that kept feeding her drinks. <br><br> I didn't think too much about it but when the night ended she could barely walk it appeared as if she had been drugged(working in the industry for so long you quickly recognize what that looks like) the man she was with told me she was his girlfriend and that he was taking her home however earlier she told me she was single so I immediatley knew she was in trouble. I immediatley got in between them told him to leave and called back up he walked away angry but left we gave her lots of water and waited until she got better. The next day she called us and thanked me for saving her. 
              <br><br>
            Being a doorman has a bad reputation for not being real work but many don't know the amount of awareness required to to truely do our jobs right. <br><br> Be safe everyone!</p>
