            <p>Working undercover at a prestigious mall can be tricky. 80% of thefts are conducted by a very small percentage of people. These people are career criminal thieves typically targeting high value smaller items. 
              <br><br>
            Through the years their tactics have become more and more complex they usually strike when traffic is at the highest usually in the afternoon from 3-6pm because the sheer volume of shoppers makes it easy to hide in the mass of faces. They also tend to wear hats or hoodies to hide their faces from the camera. Backpacks are a common accessory as well for larger consumables being targeted. <br><br>
            The biggest thing we look out for from thieves is that they always target the same products typically for example in a drug store they will target over the counter drugs that retail for 30 plus dollars. Of course we don't watch everyone that goes in this section but if we notice they are looking around excessively and spend a longer time than usual we will keep an eye on them. 
           <br><br>
           One night I was working the evening shift when we a had a culprit actually jump over the pharmacy desk and steal thousands of dollars worth of narcotics I ran towards the culprit and nearly caught him but he jumped into a van and dragged for me for several meters before we both fell out and hit the pavement. He was shortly arrested and after investigation was deemed responsible for a dozen other robberies in the city.
           <br><br>
           moments like these can be scary but I get a thrill knowing I'm stopping crime and making a difference for our clients.
