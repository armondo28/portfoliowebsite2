             <p>Our division of Cruz Security works with the vulnerable we are contracted by homeless shelters across the GTA to work the people are who dealing with mental health and addiction problems <br><br>
              When the pandemic began in March of 2020 we were already dealing with a long and deadly opiod epidemic since 2018. Claiming thousands of lives a year in North America we already had our hands full keeping our clients safe from overdoses as well as from each other. however the new virus threat just added salt to the wound not only did we have to make sure they were socially distanced but we had to handle the new encampments springing up across the city since all the homeless shelters were overloaded and full with people. <br><br>

              One night while patrolling a park I heard a loud explosion and many people yelling. I immediatley ran the towards the sound and witnessed a huge fireball that was lighting up an entire park full of people. When I realized this I approached the park while calling for back up to bring a fire extinguisher. On arrival we tended to injured people..thankfully no one was seriously hurt. The fire department shortly arrived to put out what was left of the blaze.
              <br><br>
              While our job is tough it is neccessary this sort of thing doesn't happen everyday but everyday we witness fights, overdoses and other disturbing scenes through it all it is extremely rewarding knowing we're making a difference and saving lives.
